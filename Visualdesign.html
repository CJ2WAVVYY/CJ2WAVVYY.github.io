	<h2>Artifact #1</h2>
<img src="Artifacts/StephenCurry.png" width="225" height="225" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>
	My favorite portrait out of the 3 is the pop art gradient portrait. I chose this one because Stephen Curry is one of my favorite basketball players ever. The colors I chose to make it pop were green, blue, red, and purple. First I went on google and found an image of Stephen Curry. After that I had to erase the background of the picture. Finally I had to change the color of the picture 4 times and then drag it to each corner.<br>
