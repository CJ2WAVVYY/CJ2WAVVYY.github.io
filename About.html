<h1>All About Curtis</h1>

<h1>Before BECA</h1>
<p>I was born in Bronx, NY in 2007. I went to school at PS. 53. While I was there I loved playing basketball. When I graduated elementary school at PS. 53, I decided to come here for middle school, and Iv'e been here ever since.</p>
<h2>During BECA</h2>
In middle school, I had went to after school and It was kinda fun cause we had gym for like a hour.  I loved intensives and im glad were doing It this year. I started joing clubs last year and I liked fitness . I hope there Is clubes again this year so i can join.  
<h3>After BECA</h3>
I hope that after I graduate BECA I would love to go to a all black college or If not that a good college. I would love to get a jod after I graduate college, but I don't know what job yet. As long as It's a good job and 
 I have a good future I will be good.
